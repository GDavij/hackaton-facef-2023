# Hackathon UniFacef 2023
**Group: COMP_4**
**Product Name: Trash Holder**

This repository stores all the code made during the event at day 2023-10-22

## Advices
- Please notice that this code is for a hackathon that lasts for 24 hours approximately, don't expect the code to be good for production since our team had focus first in the needs to present a product in the pitch.

- Because of our decisions to build the project as fast as possible and the average knowledge of our team (HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JS), we have decided to make the project using PHP and XAMPP to speed up development of API, and Bootstrap Css to speed up development of frontend.

- Since we focused on production instead of quality we don't have followed standards like DRY(Don't repeat yourself)

- Because that we are in the first year of Software Engineering course and your focus was much more on technology than technical documentation, we don't have had enough experience on Documentation, even if we tried don't expected to documentation to follow all standards of industry.

## Actual State
- We have a prototype of the product but nothing functional nor presentable
- We have some documentations like a Beta version of Class Diagram, a Beta Version of Use Cases Diagram, a Beta Version of Use Cases Documentation, and really important a Beta BPMN Diagram.

## What's next ?
- Try to remap the documentation for a more efficient and precise product.
- Try to refactor the code, maybe re-implement in another technology.
